# Swift Sort Performance Test
Swift sorting algorithms performance test.

The code is not as clear as I like.
I don't have time to update the code.
I just create this project to test sorting performance. 
Type less than 5000 for create numbers.
After that it crashed in simulator.
I don't use thread so while sorting the app can freeze.

Feel free to use sorting algorithms.
